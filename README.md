This program converts a JPG or PNG image into symbols.
Some other file types might also work, but it's pretty unstable right now even with these types :D (one PNG file worked but other didn't...)

The file path may either be absolute or relative to this file (and it can have double quotation marks around it).
In other words, the image can be inputted using only its name and file extension if it's in the same folder as this script.
